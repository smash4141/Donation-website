                            <p>The project reaches out to people aged 0-35 years by carrying out age-appropriate interventions on health, education, and livelihood, focused on the girl child and aimed at systemic and lasting change. A child’s development starts in the womb, however, when mothers are young, unhealthy, and lack the awareness about breastfeeding, it results in weak children. Even when they grow up, they do not have access to learning platforms as most Anganwadi centres are dilapidated and leak even after a short spell of rain. Many children remain out of school and do not have enough funds to afford a private school</p>

                            <p>Maharashtra witnessed very heavy rains in the second week of August’ 2019. This resulted in flood conditions across various districts affecting lakhs of people, resulting in crop losses, affecting farmlands, damage to kuchha houses, damage to roads connecting villages to block/ district headquarters, power failure affecting piped water supply and submergence of hand pumps.Sangli and Kolhapur were two of the worst affected districts by floods. People had returned to their villages and there was an immediate need for hygiene items and dry ration items amidst the flood affected households as it would take a couple of days to weeks before they got their house in order. Household items had been washed away, women and girls had no access to sanitary provisions.</p>
